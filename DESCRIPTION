Description: The packages provides position specific weight matrices (PWMs) for 303 human serine/threonine kinases originally published in Johnson et al. 2023. It includes gene annotation for each kinase PWM and PWM matching scores for a set of 85603 curated human phosphosites which can be used to map a PWM score to its percentile rank. The package also includes basic functionality to score user provided phosphosites.
