# JohnsonKinaseData

`JohnsonKinaseData` is an
R/[ExperimentHub](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ExperimentHub.html)
package providing access to position specific weight matrices (PWMs)
for 303 human serine/threonine kinases originally published in Johnson
et al. 2023.

The package includes functionallity to match PWMs against phosphosites
and to convert PWM scores into percentile ranks using a background
score distribution.

All data records are available under
